# E-commerce Backend

## Description 
The E-commerce Backend was created as part of a bootcamp curriculum to practice making the backend of an e-commerce website. The goal was to create the models, the apiRoutes, and configure the connection for the website. Insomnia was then used to test out the apiRoutes. Disclaimer: Starter code was provided for this challenge.
